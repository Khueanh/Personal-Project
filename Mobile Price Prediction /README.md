- numpy: A library for numerical operations and array manipulation
- sklearn.preprocessing: A module from scikit-learn for data preprocessing, specifically the OrdinalEncoder class
- seaborn: A library for data visualization
- matplotlib.pylab: A module from matplotlib for plotting and data visualization
- sklearn.model_selection: To train test split
- sklearn.linear_model: import logistic model
- sklearn.metrics: to find accuracy of models
